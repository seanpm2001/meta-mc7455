Add support for the Sierra Wirless MC7455 modem

Build the image:
1. Add meta-mc7455 to the layers direcotry of the BSP received from http://git.toradex.com/cgit/toradex-bsp-platform.git/
2. Add the following lines to local.conf:
   IMAGE_INSTALL_append = " modemmanager networkmanager"
   IMAGE_INSTALL_remove = " ofono connman connman-gnome connman-client"
   DISTRO_FEATURES_remove = " 3g" # To finally remove ofono
3. Add the following layer to bblayers.conf
   ${TOPDIR}/../layers/meta-mc7455
3. Recompile the angstrom-lxde-image
4. Install the newly created image

On the module use ModemManager and NetworkManager to connect to a network and to receive GPS information

# Say no to auto connect if the SIM has a pin
nmcli c add type gsm ifname cdc-wdm0 con-name <connection name> apn <APN> connection.autoconnect no
# To unlock the SIM use option --ask
nmcli c --ask up <connection name>
# To change connection settings (e.g. set autoconnect to yes now):
nmcli c edit <conneciton name>

For debugging use ModemManager directly:
mmcli -i 0 --pin <pin>
mmcli -m 0 -e
mmcli -m 0 --simple-connect="apn=<APN>"

Too receiving GPS data use:
mmcli -m 0 --location-enable-gps-raw --location-enable-gps-nmea
mmcli -m 0 --location-get
mmcli -m 0 --location-status
